BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================


To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "PacMan02.jar" 


Notice that the file HSK6.txt must be in the same folder from where 
you run the .jar file.

The game has been tested and works properly only under Ubuntu, at the moment.
